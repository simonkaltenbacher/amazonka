-- | Creates a value of 'ListTypes' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ltVisibility' - The scope at which the type is visible and usable in CloudFormation operations. Valid values include:     * @PRIVATE@ : The type is only visible and usable within the account in which it is registered. Currently, AWS CloudFormation marks any types you create as @PRIVATE@ .     * @PUBLIC@ : The type is publically visible and usable within any Amazon account. The default is @PRIVATE@ .
--
-- * 'ltNextToken' - If the previous paginated request didn't return all of the remaining results, the response object's @NextToken@ parameter value is set to a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call this action again and assign that token to the request object's @NextToken@ parameter. If there are no remaining results, the previous response object's @NextToken@ parameter is set to @null@ .
--
-- * 'ltDeprecatedStatus' - The deprecation status of the types that you want to get summary information about. Valid values include:     * @LIVE@ : The type is registered for use in CloudFormation operations.     * @DEPRECATED@ : The type has been deregistered and can no longer be used in CloudFormation operations.
--
-- * 'ltMaxResults' - The maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If the number of available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes a @NextToken@ value that you can assign to the @NextToken@ request parameter to get the next set of results.
--
-- * 'ltProvisioningType' - The provisioning behavior of the type. AWS CloudFormation determines the provisioning type during registration, based on the types of handlers in the schema handler package submitted. Valid values include:     * @FULLY_MUTABLE@ : The type includes an update handler to process updates to the type during stack update operations.     * @IMMUTABLE@ : The type does not include an update handler, so the type cannot be updated and must instead be replaced during stack update operations.     * @NON_PROVISIONABLE@ : The type does not include create, read, and delete handlers, and therefore cannot actually be provisioned.
